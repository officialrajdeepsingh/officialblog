Hi welcome

I will complete my study for a master of science in biotechnology in 2021. My journey started after passing 12 classes; I brought my first android mobile phone.

Then I started using mobile, and I found a video on YouTube about what programming is and how to build a website using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

That video changed my whole life. During my B.Sc., I successfully found my first internship and a job in a freelance-based company.

I got selected for a frontend developer role. My frontend development role is to convert PNG design into HTML and CSS.

Two years later, I was successfully selected for a new company. I started working with a small team, and lucky, I found a great mentor who told me about Frontend development A to z.

I started my writing career as a technical writer during my second job. Furthermore, I published my first book on Linux and a research paper with OSF.

Sometime later, I publish one more book on bioinformatics. I publish an article weekly on medium, freeCodeCamp, and other publications.

Thanks for reading my small journey.
