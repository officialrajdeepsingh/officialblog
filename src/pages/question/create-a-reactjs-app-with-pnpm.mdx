Currently, PNPM is the best node package manager in the javascript world. It is super fast to install packages and create new applications. It takes less time to compare yarn and pnpm. With pnpm, you can easily create react app with the following command.

```bash
pnpm create react-app react-app
```

Using the following command, you can create a typescript app base on react app with pnpm.

```bash
pnpm create react-app react-app --template typescript
```

You can also pass on additional options as a flag with create react app to check other information about cli.

## Options

1. `-V, --version`                            output the current version of creating react-app
2. `--verbose`                                print additional logs in your terminal
3. `--info`                                   print environment debug info
4. `--scripts-version`                        use a non-standard version of react-scripts
5. `--template`                               specify a template for the created project
6. `-h, --help`                               output usage information
