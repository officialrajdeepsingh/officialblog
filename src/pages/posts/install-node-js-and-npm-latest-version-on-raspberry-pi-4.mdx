Hey Everyone, my name is Rajdeep Singh. I'm a Front-end developer in India. you
are interested to install npm and node.js latest version in your raspberry pi 4.
then you are right place.

**Now follow these steps.**

### Steps

1. Update & Upgrade your pi
2. ARM Version
3. Go to Official Nodejs
4. Copy Link
5. Extract The File
6. Copy The Files Into The Directory
7. Check Installation

## Update & Upgrade your Pi

Fastly update your raspberry pi 4 using update commands

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

After the update command, you run the upgrade command to upgrade your raspberry pi
package.

```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## ARM Version

Now you check your raspberry pi 4 arm architecture. so that we install node js and npm
according to your arm architecture.

Check ARM architecture use the following command.

```bash
uname -m
```

Currently in my Raspberry armv7l Architecture in your case may be different.

## Copy Link

Once open node js download page. then Right-click on Linux Binaries (ARM)
version and copy the link address.

- **Without command:**

Goto node js download page and click to **ARMV7 button**. after a few seconds
you download start it.

- **With Command ( Recommended ):**

My arm Architecture is **armv7l**. so that, I copy ARMV7 Link Address. In Your
case, your ARM Architecture armv81. so that you copy **ARMV8** Link Address

![copy link address](/images/post/2021/01/copy-link-address.png "copy link address")

```bash
wget paste-your-link
```

### My example

```bash
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.15.4/node-v14.15.4-linux-armv7l.tar.xz
```

---

## Extract The File

Once downloaded Completed now Extract your file. you are extracting files by
**Raspbian File manager** and secondly, use the **tar command** according to
your mind.

**Your file looks like this:**

```bash
tar -xzf node-vXX.XX.X-linux-armvXl.tar.gz
```

**In my example my file name:**

```bash
tar -xzf node-v14.15.4-linux-armv7l
```

If you face any error use the Raspbian File manager to
extract the File. {.info}

---

## Copy The Files Into The Directory:

run node js with any directory we need to copy all extracted files into the
**"/usr/local"** folder.

**Your file looks like this:**

```bash
tar -xzf node-vXX.XX.X-linux-armvXl.tar.gz
```

**Go to your extracted folder:**

```bash
cd node-v14.15.4-linux-armv7l
```

After entering your folder then copy all files, we use the `cp command`. The
"-R" flag is to signify to the program to copy all the files recursively, i.e
include all files within folders. "*" just means to copy everything in the
folder.

```bash
sudo cp -R * /usr/local/
```

---

## Check Installation:

Now your Node js and npm are successfully Installed. now you verify your node
and npm version. the simply run the following commands

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

All work fine, you see node and npm versions.

If you run into any issues, just leave us a comment down below and we will try
to help you guys!
