Now there are lots of people using zoom for meetings. Today I will tell you the best ways to install zoom in your ubuntu.

I use snap to install zoom in my ubuntu. Most of the time, my zoom application is crashes. It is so frustrating for me.

So I used the official zoom package app and installed zoom in ubuntu. There are two ways to install zoom in your ubuntu.

1. With the help of UI
2. Command-line

## With the help of UI

There is two-step involved in installing zoom in your ubuntu.

1. Download zoom application
2. Install application

### Download zoom application

You go to the zoom official page and download the zoom application file in the first step.

### Install application

In the second step, you go to the download folder and run the application installer by pressing the mouse right-click, clicking again **open with other application** buttons, and click the **Install software** button.

**Steps** > Open file with the **mouse right-click on file** > **open with other application** > **Install software.**

After some seconds next screen is a popup, and click the install button. Your application installation process is starting.

## Command-line

There is two-step to install the zoom on the command line.

1. Install with wget command
2. Install application with `dpkg` command

### Install with wget command

In the first step, we download the zoom application file with `wget` command.

```bash
wget https://zoom.us/client/latest/zoom_amd64.deb -O zoom.deb
```

### Install application with `dpkg` command

Your file is installed in a local download folder and goes to the folder. Then run the following command.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i  zoom.deb
```

After the command successfully runs in your terminal, your zoom application is installed.

The most cases `wget` command download file is in the download folder. If you specify a different folder. you can also do that with `wget` command. then you go to the download folder and run `dpkg` the command with the file name. {.info}

## How to Uninstall zoom in ubuntu?

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge zoom
```

## Conclusion

I'm not recommended to snap to install zoom. Because of a lot of time, your zoom application is crashes, and your user experience is not so good.

Suppose you install a Debian-based zoom application in your ubuntu. I strongly recommend installing the app directly and not using any third-party package manager like snap or flatpak.
