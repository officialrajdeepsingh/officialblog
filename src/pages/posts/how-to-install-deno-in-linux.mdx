## How to delete deno in Linux?

Uninstalling the deno process is a trick for a new person. However, with my step
base guideline, you can easily delete the deno and deno configuration.

### Steps

- Delete deno folder
- Delete deno configuration

#### Delete deno folder

Firstly, You can delete the `.deno` folder in your distro. Then, you can delete
it with `sudo rm -R $HOME/.deno` command.

`sudo rm -R $HOME/.deno` command does not delete only the deno folder. It also
deletes the entire configuration and cache.

You can also remove the deno folder with `which deno` command `sudo rm -R $( which deno )`.
</Alert>

#### Delete deno configuration

In the second step, You can delete the deno configuration in `.bashrc` file.
Which is added automatically on the installation time.

open bash `.bashrc` file with any IDE. for example, I use nano Linux IDE and
open `.bashrc` file with nano `nano ./.bashrc`

After oping `.bashrc` file, then you find the following configuration.

```javascript
# Manually add the directory to your $HOME/.bashrc (or similar)
export DENO_INSTALL="/home/rajdeepsingh/.deno"
export PATH="$DENO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

If the Following configuring is found, then delete it. Now deno uninstalls
successfully in your distro.

Remove configuration in `.bashrc` file and suggest reopening the terminal or restarting your system.
