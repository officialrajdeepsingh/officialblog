Tree command help to list out the contents of directories in a tree-like format.
Tree command provides tree diagram in-depth listing files.

Most commonly use tree commands in writing documentation, and secondly, we use
tree commands to understand project directory structure.

If you use Linux and think the tree command is not your help. Because I have UI
to understand every directory. that time, you're mistaken.

Most of the time app or project is very big. Because of many files, folders, or
directories in the app, you do not observe and understand what happens in the
app and which folders and files are stored. Secondly, where I store my custom
components are directories and folders.

You also face the same problem. Then you are right place. You understand the
tree command concept by example.

The most common example. When I build React.js open-source admin dashboard, I
create many custom components and directories for my app., like header, footer,
nav, and card directories, to separate every custom component and sass file.

This structure, I understand. But this is an open-source project. When I write
documentation for the open-source react dashboard on GitHub. Then I manually
design an image to tell others which folder to have a header component you
change and where is asset folder is.

I just run the tree command to design a simple tree structure in my command
terminal and use it in your documentation.
