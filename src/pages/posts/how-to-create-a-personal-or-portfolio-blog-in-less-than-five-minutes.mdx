Start your portfolio or blog website with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [nextra](https://nextra.site/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [section blog theme](https://section-blog-theme-docs.vercel.app/) in less than five minutes, even if you are a beginner or pro developer.

Next.js is a React.js-based open-source framework. You can use it to build modern small to large-scale websites using server-side rendering and static website generation.

Nextra is a Next.js-based open-source framework. Nextra is a content-focused tool for static site generation. With Nextra, you can quickly build Markdown-based content using the Nextra theme.

I built my own nextra-theme using modern UI and tools. I named it the [**section blog theme**](https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/section-blog-theme-demo). It's based on React.js, Nextjs, Typescript, Radix UI, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.

All the source code are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/section-blog-theme-demo). You can also check out the [live demo](https://section-blog-theme-demo.vercel.app/) website.

The [section blog theme](https://section-blog-theme-docs.vercel.app/) is a nextra-based theme I built that I maintain. You can use it to create a portfolio website or a personal blog.

The theme has some helpful built-in features:

*   SEO Support
*   Inbuilt dark and light mode
*   Inbuilt Search functionality
*   Navigation functionality
*   Multiple Layout Support
*   Multiple Theme Support
*   Easy to customize

To get started using Next.js, Nextra, and the section blog theme, you'll need the following:

1.  Latest Node version
2.  Node package manager (NPM, Yarn, or PNPM)
3.  Basis knowledge of React, Next, and MDX (Markdown).

Here are the steps you'll need to follow to install and configure the section blog theme in Nextra and Next.js:

1.  [Create a new project with Next.js.](#create-a-new-project-with-next-js)
2.  [Install Nextra and the section blog theme](#install-nextra-and-the-section-blog-theme)
3.  [Configure Nextra and the section blog theme](#configure-nextra-and-the-section-blog-theme-)
4.  [Define the layout](#define-the-layout)
5.  [How to choose different themes](#how-to-choose-different-themes)
6.  [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Create a New Project with Next.js
---------------------------------

To get started, you'll need to create a fresh Next project. You can do that with the [create next app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app) CLI using NPM, yarn, or pnpm.

```
npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app
```


During installation, the Create Next App CLI will ask you some questions. Nextra can't support app routes, so you'll need to select the **page route** instead.

```
What is your project named?  my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript?  No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint?  No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?  No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory?  No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)  No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)?  No / Yes
```


I choose pnpm to create the Next app, and the command output looks like this:

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest
.../share/pnpm/store/v3/tmp/dlx-55250    |   +1 +
.../share/pnpm/store/v3/tmp/dlx-55250    | Progress: resolved 1, reused 1, downloaded 0, added 1, done

Install Nextra and the Section Blog Theme
-----------------------------------------

The next step is to install the [nextra](https://nextra.site/) and [section-blog-theme](https://section-blog-theme-docs.vercel.app/) packages in your project. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install nextra section-blog-theme
# or 
yarn add nextra section-blog-theme
# or 
pnpm add nextra section-blog-theme

```


Install the nextra and section-blog-theme packages.

The nextra and section blog theme packages should be installed successfully in your project. The next step is configuring Nextra and the section blog theme together in Next.js.

Configure Nextra and the Section Blog Theme.
--------------------------------------------

To configure the section blog theme, nextra in nextjs, follow these steps.

### Steps

1.  Configure the section blog theme and nextra in the  `next.config.ts` file.
2.  Create `theme.config.jsx` file.
3.  Rename the `_app.tsx` to `_app.mdx`.
4.  Import CSS.
5.  Create `theme.config.jsx` file.

### Configure the section blog theme and nextra in the  next.config.ts file.

Paste the following code into the `next.config.ts` file to configure the section blog theme in nextra.

```jsx
const withNextra = require("nextra")({
  theme: "section-blog-theme",
  themeConfig: "./theme.config.jsx",
});
 
module.exports = withNextra(); 
```

### Rename the `app.tsx` to `app.mdx`

The next step is to rename your `app.tsx` to `app.mdx` file.

```jsx
// Rename _app.tsx to _app.mdx
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

### Import CSS

Lastly, import the section blog theme production CSS file inside the `_app.mdx` file. Copy the following code.

```jsx
import "section-blog-theme/styles.css"
```
Then paste into `_app.mdx` file.

```jsx
import "section-blog-theme/styles.css"
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

### Create a `theme.config.jsx` file.

Lastly, create a new `theme.config.jsx` file in your project root level and paste the following code.

```jsx
const themeConfig = {
    settings: {
      title: "Start your blog or portfolio using MDX, Next.Js, and Nextra.",
      description: "Section blog theme is build with Nextjs and tailwind css.",
      SiteURL: "https://officialrajdeepsingh.dev"
    },

      ),
      link: "/",
      target: "_blank",
    },
    PrimaryNavigation: [
      {
        href: "/",

  export default themeConfig;

Paste the following code into `index.mdx` file.

```jsx
---

## Hello world

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit dolore vitae deleniti tempore.
```



Then start your development server using NPM or yarn and pnpm.

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```


After your running development, your website looks like this in the browser.

Define Layout

The section blog theme uses `type` metadata in Markdown to define the layout structure. In the section blog theme, there are six types of layouts available.

### Layouts:

1.  [Home Layout](#home-layout)
2.  [Page Layout](#page-layout)
3.  [Post Layout](#post-layout)
4.  [Posts Layout](#posts-layout)
5.  [Tag Layout](#tag-layout)
6.  [404 Layout](#404-layout)

### Home Layout

Home Layout is used to create a home or root page in your blog. When somebody opens your website in the browser. They see your home page.

```markdown

```

Your home page looks like this in the browser.

### Post Layout

Create a new post in the section blog theme, and you must pass additional `type:post` front matter property in the Markdown.

Make sure first to create a `posts` folder inside the project, then create a new `src/pages/posts/how-to-fetch-the-data-in-nextjs.mdx` post with mdx extension.

```markdown

---
type: post
title: How to fetch theb data in nextjs?

To enable the tag, then paste the following code into the `src/pages/tags/[tag].mdx`file.

```markdown
---

---

import { TagName, TagTitle } from "section-blog-theme/Tag";

<TagTitle />
