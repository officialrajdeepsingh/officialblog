Npm is the node package manager for JavaScript. The npm help manage code and
share code with others developers. We start the Npm series for beginners to
pro-level developers.

Our first command is the npm init command. Next, create a package.json file in
the folder.

```bash
npm init <Options>
```

### Options

1. npm init --yes or -y
2. npm init aliases or create aliases
3. npm init -w

## npm init --yes or-y

The npm init command help to create a node.js setup for the developer. In
step-up, the init command creates a package.json file and add a basic
configuration related to the project in the package.json file.

```bash
npm init -y
```

**`Npm init -y`** flag is most common flag in npm. lots of developers use it daily in the day. **`-y flag`** help to create an essential step up with the `package.json` file.

Inside the `package.json` file, eight properties by default define it.

```json
{
	"name": "npmtest",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	},
	"keywords": [],
	"author": "",
	"license": "ISC"
}
```

1. **`Name`** help to define the name of the project.
2. **`Version`** help to define the version of your project or app.
3. **`Description`** help to define a small introduction of your project.
4. The **`main`** property tells which is the project's entry point.
5. **`Script`** help to define the different command for npm.
6. **`Keywords`** help for searching and indexing package on npmjs.org.
7. The **`author`** help define the authorship of the project.
8. **`License`** help define your project's licensing.

## npm init aliases or create aliases

Most of the time, many people use a create an alias. The **create aliases** are
the most common alias for react.js developers. So if you are a react.js developer,
most of the time, you use it to create an alias.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app

or

npx create-next-app@latest
```

With the npm init command, you can install the direct package from [npmjs.org](npmjs.org).

For example, purpose creates a nextjs app with npm init. By default, npm init
create an alias.

```bash
npm init next-app
```

In creating an alias, you do not need to mention create prefixes at the front of
the command. Init command by default use creates prefix. It runs the
`create-next-app@latest` version.

Your init next-app command output looks like.

```bash
npm init create-next-app
```

## npm init -w

npm init -w command is similar to npm init -w. but npm init -w command help to
set up your workspace with the project.

```json
{
	"name": "npmtest",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	},
	"keywords": [],
	"author": "",
	"license": "ISC",
	"workspaces": [
		"true"
	]
}
```

npm init -w command add workspaces option in package.json fileâ€”the workspace
help for IDE.
