The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph. Use to `<p>` tag create a new
paragraph on a web page. It has an own `</p>` closing tag. This is optional
because a paragraph automatically ends when we start another paragraph.

**Syntax:**

```bash
<p> Paragraph Tag </p>
```

#### Note

- Large or small screens and resized windows You will see different results on a web page.
- The web browser also removes extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph we add new line start  another paragraph,   add extra spaces will be removed by browsers</p>
```
