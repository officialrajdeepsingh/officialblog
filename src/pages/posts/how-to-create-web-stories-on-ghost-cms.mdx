### Conclusion

The visual story is a greater platform for creating an amp web story for your
website. The visual story is a free service for everyone. But earn revenue by
selling API.

One thing in the visual story that is bad is the dashboard UI. The dashboard UI
is very confusing for a beginner. To understand dashboard UI, you need to spend
a little time on the website dashboard.
