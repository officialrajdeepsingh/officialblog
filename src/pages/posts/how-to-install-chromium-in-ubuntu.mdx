Chromium is an open-source web browser for Linux users. Chrome is not
open-source software. but chrome build use of chromium. chromium is an old
library maintained by the google team.

Ubuntu, by default, provides a firefox browser if you like browsing with
chromium. You do not need any third-party manager to install chromium like a
snap store or snap command to install chromium.

Most of the time, raspberry pi users install Ubuntu on raspberry pi 4. raspberry
pi 4 supports arm64 and armhf architecture. but chrome browser built with amd64
architecture. that reason chrome browser does not install on arm64 and armhf
architecture. both architecture arm64 and amd64 binary are different.

If Your Ubuntu comes with in-build amd64 architecture, you do not need to install chromium in your Ubuntu. I suggest you use chrome. {.info}
