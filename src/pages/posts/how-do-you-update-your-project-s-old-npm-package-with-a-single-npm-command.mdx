NPM is a popular package manager for nodejs developers. When our project is big, and as a developer, we need to update node js regularly, but for a larger project, it takes lots of time to check and update every package one by one. Instead, we use npm in-built functionality to update all old node.js packages with one single command.

## How to check which node.js package is old?

For that, npm provide the `npm outdated` command that helps to print a list of the old package in the terminal.

```bash
npm outdated
```

## How to update all the old node.js packages?

You need to run only one `npm update` command to update all old nodejs packages with a single command.

```bash
npm update
```

## How to update only one old nodejs package?

You update a single package by package name with the npm update command.

```bash
npm update next
```
