</Alert>

Ghost CMS very easily integrates with google's custom search bar. You copy and
paste code in your ghost theme and update. After a second google search bar
appears on your website.

In this article, I'm showing you a search bar functionality with a
[Ghost Casper theme](https://ghost.org/themes/casper/).

### Let's start it

1. Open Google Programmable Search Engine
2. Add code in your Theme

## Open Google Programmable Search Engine

Firstly go to the
[Programmable Search Engine dashboard](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all?optin=true)
create an account help of google when your account creates successfully. Google Programmable Search Engine dashboard looks like in the browser.

- Search Engine Create Successfully

### Add Search Engines

In This Page, you fill your search engine name. You fill in any name which you
like. After adding your website, click to add button. Your website adds
successfully. Now click on to create button.

### Search Engine Create SuccessFully

When your search engine creates successfully, you see a confirmation page, copy
your code, and paste it inside your Theme.

Customize the option shows you all customization for your search engine, and the
preview page tells how to look at the search bar like your show on your website.

### Code breakdown

Script tag allows adding a search bar to your website. in a script tag, also
have your Programmable search engine unique id. That id help in the
customization of search bar functionality on the Google dashboard.

## Add code in your Theme

Firstly open your [Ghost Casper theme](https://ghost.org/themes/casper/) or any
other theme you like and open it in your favorite code editor(IDE).

### Copy Code

```javascript
<script async src="https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=5440b4783041f4ed2"></script>
<div class="gcse-search"></div>
```

### Paste code

You open the Casper theme in the code editor and open **default.hbs** file in
the code editor. You paste code in the header section.

![Paste Google Programmable Search Engine code in your ghost theme](/images/post/2021/10/add-searchbar-in-ghost.png "Paste Google Programmable Search Engine code in your ghost theme")

I open **default.hbs** file and paste custom google search bar code after
navigation (Line number 21) div in Casper theme.

You show the search bar in different places. You paste code according to your
thought. But logic is the same for all **ghost themes**.

### Add CSS

```html
<div class="gcse-search"></div>
```

You target the **gcse-search** class and apply your CSS properties to the Casper
theme. Make sure you write and paste your CSS into the following path.

![Add CSS on your Theme](/images/post/2021/10/APPLY-CSS-ON-GHOST-THEME.png "Add CSS on your Theme")

```css
screen.css
.gse-searchbox {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 400px;
}
```

Apply CSS in Ghost their many ways. but I'm showing you a common way in the image
to apply your custom CSS. Most of the CSS changes in the google dashboard with
one click. if you are not satisfied. then your apply custom CSS add an inbuilt
folder.

In other ways, you also create a CSS separate file built-in folder and attach
it to your ghost theme.

### Conclusion

I think Google Programmable Search Engine fan is easy to integrate with Ghost
and any other website. But google search functionality work only when your
website adds on the google webmaster tool. Otherwise, your search is not very
good for other users. Maybe after some time, ghost cms official launch search
functionality for Theme. Right now, ghost cms do not do that. But use ghost API,
you also build custom search functionality for your Theme. in the next article,
we also discuss that.
