In recent times, I have been attracted to the brave browser. Brave browser is
attractive with many features. But I like it. Only one feature is strong ad-block.

### Installation

1. Official command
2. Snap

### Official command

You can install a brave browser with official command. if you have already
installed `apt-transport-https` and `curl` package in your machine. Then you
skip the first step.

Otherwise, both packages are not installed on your machine. the first step is to
install `apt-transport-https` and `curl` package in your machines.

```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl
```

Next, step up the brave browser repository and package with the following
commands.

```bash
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg arch=amd64] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ stable main"|sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt install brave-browser
```

After you run step by step command in the terminal, in the end, you can install
the brave browser.
