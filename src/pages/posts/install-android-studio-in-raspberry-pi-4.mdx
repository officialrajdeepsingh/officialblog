Android Studio does not support raspberry pi 4. Currently, the android studio
supports only Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

In Linux, officially, Android supports only Amd64 (64-bit processor)
architecture operating system. So if you use Raspberry pi 4, raspberry pi 3,
and other similar hardware, run on Arm64 architecture. Then make sure you do not
install android studio on it. Whatever you use any method to try to install
android studio on it.

Check arm64 architecture in Debian-based distros.

```bash
sudo dpkg --print-architecture
```

Some people say you use Debian multi-architecture to install i386 architecture
and then install android studio. I also try it. But it does not work for me.

Firstly you enable the installation of multi-architecture binaries, apt, and
dpkg need configuration changes. So, for example, if you have an amd64
architecture that you want to install i386 libraries onto, do the following:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0 libstdc++6:i386 libfontconfig1:i386 libxext6:i386 libxrender1:i386 libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0:i386
```

i386 repo links are broken. It does not install in your raspberry pi 4.

If you install ubuntu on raspberry pi 4. after running these commands, install
android-studio on your raspberry pi 4. it does not install android-studio in
your raspberry pi 4.

#### Best Ways to download Android in arm64 by snap

Firstly install snap package manager install your raspberry pi 4. after
installation is complete, paste the snap android-studio install command in your
raspberry pi 4. But the Android-studio snap command is also not working for
raspberry pi 4.

```bash
sudo snap install android-studio --classic
```

Arm 64 is the main reason I wouldn't say I like raspberry pi 4 because lots of
software and packages do not support arm64 architecture. They only support amd64
architecture. I know arm64 is not 32bit; it is 64-bit architecture support.

I know some people raspberry pi 4 is a small PC to build projects on li. So you
use raspberry pi 4 to start working Linux. But my opinion is arm 64 architecture
is a very big problem for developers. So which developers are working frontend
developer, full-stack, and mobile app development?
