There are so many manufacturers to build Linux custom laptops for clients. In
recent years Linux operating system has grown on the boom. I do not need to
explain why we need Linux operating system, why we use Linux to deploy small and
big websites on the cloud.

On an E-commerce website, Sellers does not list official Linux hardware built
for Linux. Because the seller does not manufacture are of Linux laptops, Mini
PC, and PC. Therefore, the Linux market is tiny as compared to window and mac
os. There are many reasons why people do not use Linux daily basis. They are
using windows and mac os daily. Because Windows and c target everyone and Linux
target professional people with basic knowledge of computers and commands. That
is why most companies build Windows operating systems, and few build Linux
hardware and Linux distros.

Window and mac os does not directly support Linux. You use tools and software to
install and use Linux distro on it.

Linux is a tiny size and open-source kernel. That reason, there are so many
manufacturers to build Linux laptops and Linux distros for professionals. The
new Linux distro is user-friendly, and new people also use it in daily life.

In the post, we discuss some major Linux manufacturers to build Linux laptops
and sell them worldwide. Maybe they sell Linux hardware in a few countries.

### Conclusion

There are other companies and startups manufacturers that build Linux laptops,
desktops, and mini PC. In This Time, many distro and manufacturers are working
with Linux. These manufacturers and distro work together, build Linux hardware,
software to raise the Linux eco-system.

Every Linux manufacturers work fantastically. If you buy a Linux laptop, you
make sure. you follow three main points before buying any Linux laptops and ask
yourself:-

1. There are many manufacturers to build custom laptops for you. But make sure
   they provide services in your country.
2. Custom duty change and different each country, make sure you confirm
   manufacturers and research before buying a laptop.
3. The manufacturer provides any customer support services for a client. If you
   face any trouble with the hardware and software, they find and solve it.

If you are Indian like me and you also buy a Linux laptop. Firstly contact
manufacturers and confirm my three-point before purchasing a computer.

Right now, India does not have a company or startup to build custom laptops with
Linux. So if you buy a Linux laptop, I highly recommend you build your PC.

You try to buy a Linux laptop out of the country in India. However, for Indians,
it is costly because with Indian custom duty product prices is extra high. so I
recommend you build your PC.

I'm only selecting those companies based on reviews and services. If you are
interested to learn all companies. then read the following articles also:-
