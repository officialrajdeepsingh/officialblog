Ubuntu built the snap store package Eco-system. The Snap store help to
distribute your Linux base application and software across the Linux distros.

For checking the binary, you do not need any command. You need only two things.
First is a web browser and a mouse.

There is two binary support by raspberry pi 4. first is `arm64` and `armhf`.
If one of the binary is present, you can install the package in your raspberry
pi 4 without any problem.

**There is two way to check the package binary is available for raspberry pi 4 or not.**

1. First way
2. Second way

In this article, I use the snap chromium package for example purpose.{.info}

## First way

Firstly, you click on **the version drop-down list** and click again to **show
the architecture** drop-down list and check all available binary forms for the
list.
