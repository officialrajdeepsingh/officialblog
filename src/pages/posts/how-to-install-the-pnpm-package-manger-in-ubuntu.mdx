Pnpm (**performant npm**) is a similar package manager to the npm and yarn. NPM,
Pnpm and yarn package managers work for nodejs. PNPM is a fast and secure
package manager for nodejs. You can easily install PNPM in your ubuntu.

There are three ways to install PNPM in ubuntu.

### Steps

1. Curl
2. Wget
3. NPM

## Curl

Install PNPM with the curl command. Firstly download locally, and after the curl
command runs `install.sh` bash file runs automatically.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

#### **Command output**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
==> Extracting pnpm binaries 7.0.0
Copying pnpm CLI from /tmp/tmp.rmncvtCcXR/pnpm to /home/rajdeepsingh/.local/share/pnpm/pnpm
Updated /home/rajdeepsingh/.bashrc
Setup complete. Open a new terminal to start using pnpm.
```

## Wget

It does not have the curl command installed in your system, and you use the wget
command in ubuntu. Wget command works similar to the curl command.

```bash
wget -qO- https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

NPM, you can install pnpm with npm and yarn using the following command.

or

yarn global add pnpm
```

## How to update PNPM?

To update the pnpm with a one command.

## Conclusion

PNPM is the next future of the node package manager. Slowly pnpm is growing
among developers in the near day. I think lots of people start using pnpm in the
project.

The second thing I hope developers, teachers, writers and YouTubers raise
awareness about is pnpm. So lots of developers use pnpm daily in life.

I hope you can install pnpm in your ubuntu without any problem. If you face any
issues, let me know in the comment section.
