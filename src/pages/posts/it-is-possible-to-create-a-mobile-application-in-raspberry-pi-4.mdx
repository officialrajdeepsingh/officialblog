Yes, it is possible and second is not possible. Both terms are true in raspberry pi 4. you do not build direct applications like installing flutter, android
studio(Java), react native, and start a mobile app.

I convert my article into two-part to understand the concept.

1. The direct way to build an application
2. The indirect way to build an application

### The direct way to build an application

In The direct ways, it is impossible to create the mobile application with
raspberry pi 4. 

because I tried it and I'm Failed. Suppose you try to create a mobile application with android studio. You can do that because the android
studio does not support raspberry pi. Android studio is a very large library, and raspberry pi 4 does not handle a large library.

The second popular way to build a mobile app with flutter. React-native and another hybrid framework. I know you can install flutter very easily as compere
to react-native. But you cant create a mobile application.

### Why is it not possible build to the mobile app directly with Raspberry pi 4?

There is some point which I discuss with you. Why do we do not build a mobile app with raspberry pi 4?

- Android Studio does not support raspberry pi 4 binary.
- react-native and Flutter come with a large number of dependencies or packages.
- Run both React-native and Flutter; we need lots of RAM.
- Less read and write speed in raspberry pi 4.

### The indirect way to build an application

In indirect ways, you do not install direct packages like flutter and react-native into raspberry pi 4. You use an online cloud base Ide as
[AWS cloud 9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) and [google cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) to build a mobile app.

Cloud IDE is fine to build a small and medium apps. But building a large and complex app is not possible with Raspberry pi 4.

### Which IDE do I Recommend in aws cloud 9 and google cloud shell?

Feature point of view I recommended the cloud 9 IDE. Money and use of easiness I
recommended using google cloud shell.

**Google Cloud shell is very cheap compared to AWS cloud 9.**

### Does the online IDE work?

Yes, it works. I build a react-native application with google cloud shell it works fine. But some, time browser is stuck for a second. Otherwise, everything
is fine.

In flutter, I'm Running a flutter sample app for testing. It works fine on cloud shell. But I'm not building an app with flutter. Because I'm not a flutter
developer. For Running flutter, flutter provides an SDK for Linux. First, config that, Then you run the flutter app on ubuntu. I read

You do not Install Android studio. For that reason, you build only hybrid apps with React-native and flutter.

## Conclusion

You build an app for learning purposes in Raspberry. It is fine and works. If you build a large app, Raspberry pi is not the right place.
