Snap is a command cli tool designed by Ubuntu and Canonical. Snap cli does not
work single. It is part of the software. according to snap documentation.

1. snap is both the command line interface and the application package format
2. snapd is the background service that manages and maintains your snaps
3. snapcraft is the command and the framework used to build your snaps
4. Snap Store provides a place to upload your snaps and for users to browse and install.

This term decides by official docs, which are correct. But as a beginner-level
developer, snap is a cli tool that helps install software on different Linux
distros. Because in the Linux ecosystem, there are many distros available for
developers and Linux lovers.

Suppose somebody deploys their software on each distro on Linux. In that case,
that is very time-consuming. At that time, snap helps build package binary and
deploy on the snap store so that everyone installs software, according to distro.

## How to check snap-cli install in your raspberry4?

Check your snap cli install or not install raspberry pi 4. if this command show
error, that means snap-cli does not install in your raspberry pi 4. Because in
current time, the snap store does not support all package support installation
to raspberry pi 4 binary. The most cases, raspberry pi os, does not provide by
default support of snap-cli.
