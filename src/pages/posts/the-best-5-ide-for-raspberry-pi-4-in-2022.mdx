I use many IDE as a Raspberry pi user for a frontend developer. I give you 5 IDE lists that you consider to use in daily life without any problem. You can also
build massive projects, i.e., mobile apps, reactjs apps, vue.js web app, and anguler.js web apps.

All the Browser base IDE come with zero configuration. You start to write coding inside your browser. You use whatever browser all Ide work perfectly.

## Why did I'm selected these 5 IDE?

You write daily code basis, use the browse base ide. You need two features must be in your IDE.

1. Command-line Terminal
2. Download and upload Images, Files, etc.

### Command-line Terminal

The Command-line terminal help to execute all your commands, i.e., npm, git, etc., in your browser base IDE.

### Download and upload Images, Files, etc.

You upload local images, CSS, js, etc., files in an online IDE and download IDE files in your local machine.

---

## Why I'm selected another IDE?

I select only 5 IDE because I know tons of IDE are available in the market. But I mention only those IDE is fine in raspberry pi 4 and come with a free plan to
new users. 

For example, stackblitz comes with similar features like codesandbox. But I've not selected stackblitz Ide because of the performance issue.
stackblitz is terrible performance in raspberry pi 4.

I converted my list into three parts to better understand the concept.

1. Beginner level
2. Intermediate level
3. Advance level

## Beginner level

- Code sandbox
- Gitpod

### Code sandbox

[Code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) is a great IDE, without a doubt. In addition, Codesandbox provides excellent support of the javascript library.

Code sandbox comes with a free and pro plan. But I'm using only a free plan. So
if you are a bigger-level person, I recommend using Code sandbox.

#### Drawback

There is two main drop back in the code sandbox.

1. One drop back is a performance not good in raspberry pi 4. if managed with a
   performance issue, then codesandbox for you.
2. Sometimes, the editor does not edit files, and the code does not load in the
   browser, showing only the loading bar.

<Alert>
If you use codesandbox on raspberry pi 4. The new update code sandbox website does not load properly in chromium. It is lacy and show performance error.
</Alert>

### Gitpod

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is a great IDE as compared to code sandbox. You never face any issue like code sandbox IDE. Gitpod provides less library support
as compere to code sandbox. But it is suitable for new users.

#### Drawback

The major Drawback is Gitpod IDE comes with 50 hours of free time. after your free time finish, you need to shift free to the pro plan.

If you are a beginner developer and student, the pro plan is unsuitable. Suppose you have any issue related to money. You use code sandbox IDE and other similar
IDE. 

You have money; I recommend buying the pro plan of Gitpod, and I never suggest buying code sandbox pro plan.

<Alert>
Both Codesandbox and Gitpod work for frontend developer. it is not working with python, C, C++,rest, etc.
</Alert>

## Intermediate level

1. Cloud shell
2. Cloud 9

### Cloud shell

[Cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) is cloud base browser IDE provided by google cloud. You access cloud shell IDE inside google cloud console. It is a
separate part of the instance.

The cloud shell is my favorite IDE because you do not need any configuration and Installation. It comes with zero configuration. You click the cloud shell
icon, and your IDE is start working.

Cloud shell comes with a free and paid plan. In the free plan, you access cloud shell editor 50 hours quota per week free after charge based on your uses.

<Alert>
Cloud shell Editor comes with Zero drawbacks. You use cloud shell IDE in raspberry 4 with any issue.
</Alert>

### Cloud 9

[Cloud 9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is similar IDE like cloud shell both work similar both stable of Raspberry pi 4. So start working in cloud 9. First,
you create an instance in the AWS cloud. Then you start working.

Cloud 9 comes with a Paid plan. AWS charges based on your uses. AWS cloud 9 comes with more features than google cloud shell IDE.

#### Drawback

- Cloud 9 IDE comes with a paid plan
- A charge is very high
- For Installation, you need basic knowledge of AWS

<Alert>
Cloud shell and cloud 9 you work with any language both IDE support various language.
</Alert>

## Advance level

1. Neovim

### Neovim

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is the best open-source IDE for Linux uses. Neovim is terminal base IDE. Other IDE which I mention all IDE is browser base. All Ide
contains a lot of memory of the machine, and other hand neovim have less memory. 

Neovim is free, and you do not feel any issue with raspberry pi 4. All work perfectly.

#### Drawback

- Neovim configuration is not Easy.
- It would help if you had a basic understanding of vim Linux IDE. Because of neovim base on open-source vim terminal IDE.

<Alert>
Neovim works perfectly for all languages. you can use neovim for python, go, rest, etc. the raspberry pi 4 is not good for developing a node.js base application. nodejs development bundle consumes lots of memory and ram. that reason raspberry is not good for node.js. But node.js works fine. you do not install any npm package for i.e. reactjs, next.js, gatsby, js, etc in raspberry pi 4. most of the time you face architecture errors. so that reason i recommended to you use cloud base IDE.

</Alert>

## Faq

### Cloud 9 vs Cloud shell?

1. AWS created cloud 9 IDE, and Google created cloud shell.
2. Cloud 9 comes with paid service, and cloud shell comes with a free and paid
   plan.
3. Cloud 9 is not easy for beginners, and cloud shell is very Easy.
4. Cloud 9 provide more IDE feature as comper to cloud shell.

### Which IDE do I select in cloud 9 vs cloud shell?

For beginner person, I recommend you choose cloud shell if you have any experience with the cloud and need more features, select cloud 9.

### How much pay for cloud base IDE?

It depends open your uses cases; if you use cloud shell IDE, it gives 50 hours quota, then charges on your use.

### How to open an AWS and Google account without a credit card In India?

You use net banking and create a free virtual credit card with your bank. Then, you use a virtual credit card and open an account in AWS and Google after using
free credit and running browser IDE on the cloud.

### Does the others cloud provider provide browser-based IDE?

I do not know whatever other cloud providers provide similar browser-based IDE. So you check yourself.

## Conclusion

If you are a new person, I suggest using codesandbox IDE. I know the performance is an issue. But it is acceptable for a new person.

You have some expression of coding; I highly recommend using google cloud shell. Google shell editor provides perfect and similar features to vscode.

You build python, go, rest, other language base projects. I suggest using neovim. It is a very fast IDE. If you use Vscode IDE in raspberry pi 4, you face
performance base issues. Sometimes your IDE is stuck and does not load. So I suggest using neovim.

I know neovim is not an easy IDE. you spent some time learning the basic commands of neovim.

<Alert>
You use IDE like vscode, neovim, and others IDE in raspberry pi four locally. However, you face the issue of some packages not working and are comfortable with raspberry pi four architecture (arm64). So that reason, I recommended using browser-based IDE.
