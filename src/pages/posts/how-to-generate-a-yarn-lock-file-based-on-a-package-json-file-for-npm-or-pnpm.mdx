Yarn is a popular package manager among the developer community. There are many tools, and the library uses yarn and npm package manager. 

PNPM is a new package manager for nodejs. Recently, I created a new nextjs application based on pnpm. On the GitHub page deploy time, I need `yarn.lock` file. But the `yarn.lock` file creates by `yarn install` command. That is not true, but you can also create a `yarn.lock` file with the following command.

```bash
yarn generate-lock-entry >> yarn.lock
```

![yarn.lock](/images/yarn.lock.png "yarn.lock")

The `yarn generate-lock-entry` command generates a lock file given the current `package.json` manifest file.
